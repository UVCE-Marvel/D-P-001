# Electronic Design
## 1. Smooth Operator  
- **Prerequisite**: A basic understanding of [Amplitude Modulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqTv6jdUPL4)  
- **Objective**: Building a complete AM Transmitter–Receiver pair with a focus on Demodulation using a DIY Envelope Detector.  
- **Task Description**:  
  Construct a simple AM **Transmitter and Receiver**. You'll focus on the **demodulator** stage—using a diode-capacitor-resistor network to extract the original audio signal. You’ll critically evaluate how the [**RC time constant**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKDF110GEwU) affects the demodulated signal’s fidelity and clarity. This hands-on build will help you understand both signal transmission and analog demodulation concepts.  
  - **Platform**: Breadboard (Hardware task)
  - **Expected Task Outcomes**:
    - Understand how a [**Colpitts oscillator**](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=colpitts+oscillator) can generate a carrier signal for AM transmission.
    - Construct and fine-tune a **DIY envelope detector** using diode + RC network.
    - Analyze how **component values (R and C)** affect demodulation quality.
    - Observe AM signals at various stages using a multimeter or oscilloscope.
  - **Resources**:  
    - [Simple AM Radio Project – Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Simple-AM-Radio-Transmitter-Receiver/)  
    - [Envelope Detector – Analog Dialogue](https://www.analog.com/media/en/analog-dialogue/studentzone/studentzone-09-2024.pdf)

**Concept Spotlight: Envelope Detector**  
Imagine an AM signal as a voice hidden inside a bumpy wave. The envelope detector "traces" the bumpy outline and pulls the voice out. The **diode** only allows one direction of current—like a gate—while the **capacitor** smoothens the bumps, and the **resistor** controls how quickly it resets. Together, they decode the message hidden in the carrier wave.
