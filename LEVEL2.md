## Computational Fluid Dynamics
Import the Aerofoil designed in Level 1. Task 2. a and simulate it in a wind tunnel using Autodesk CFD.
Calculate the lift force generated by the Aerofoil when the velocity of air flowing in the wind tunnel is 28ms^-1
Generate a report on it and furnish it in your report.

## Prototyping
### Sourcing & Materials Selection
Create a list of inventory required to make an electric bicycle
Parameters to keep in mind
Max weight`= 90kg
Max speed	= 40kmph
Max range	= 50km per charge
Furnish a detailed report for the same.

### Animation and rendering
  Design a Lego structure in Fusion 360 and use motion studies to animate the entire assembly. Use rendering option in fusion 360 to simulate various environments
Render the Lego man on a busy street with cobblestone texture.Prefer sunset timing.Try including some Soviet era tanks in the background.

## E L E C T R O N I C S
### Create A Voltage Multiplier!!
Voltage multiplier using capacitor pumps and a 555 Timer IC.
To do:
Pump up 9V to 18V at first, then cascade the pump to get 27V.
Use TinkerCad to design the required circuit

### Create a circuit that provides short-circuit protection.
A circuit when shorted can cause serious damage to the equipment. Create a circuit that provides the necessary protection.

[Resources](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Make-Short-Circuit-Protection-Circuit/)
### Colpitts Chaos
Create a Colpitts oscillator circuit using an operational amplifier(IC747) to produce a sinusoidal waveform. Understand the behavior of an oscillator circuit and the role of feedback in sustaining oscillations. Generate a frequency of oscillation around 1 kHz.
Use LTspice for simulation.

### The Great Adder Escapade
Learn the basics of verilog and implement a 4 bit full adder by cascading 4 Full Adders, in the process do gate level modelling for each full adder. Write a testbench to simulate the same.
Use Vivado Design suite for implementing this task.
