### 1.Make basic gates using TTL logic.
Make basic AND, OR designs using NPN transistors, using TinkerCAD
Resource:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWlD7gL9gS0&t=524s

### 2.Driving an N-channel MOSFET
An N-Channel MOSFET is a type of MOSFET in which the channel of the MOSFET is composed of a majority of electrons as current carriers. When the MOSFET is activated and is on, the majority of the current flowing are electrons moving through the channel. 
Use TinkerCAD to get the basic design.

### 3.LOGIC DESIGN
Implement and design a full adder using 2x1 Multiplexers to generate sum and carry using open source circuit design software like CircuitVerse and document your implementation table

### 4.FILTER DESIGN
Design a second order band pass filter using IC741 that amplifies the signal to roughly 1.5 times the original signal.Cutoff range between 4kHz and 10kHz. (Use LTspice)


### 5.Matlab OnRamp

### 6.Design and Implement a 4-bit ALU

Your task is to design and implement a **4-bit Arithmetic** Logic Unit (ALU) in [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/). The ALU should perform the following operations: **addition, subtraction (using 2’s complement), and logical operations (AND, OR, XOR)**. You must also design a **control unit** to select the desired operation based on input signals and display the result along with any carry/overflow flags when applicable.

Start by creating a 4-bit adder using basic logic gates, ensuring correct handling of carry bits. Extend this design to support subtraction by using 2’s complement, and then implement the logical functions (AND, OR, XOR) with the same 4-bit inputs. The ALU must be efficient in terms of gate usage and scalable for future expansion. **Bonus challenge:** Add a feature to invert all bits of a 4-bit input (negation).
